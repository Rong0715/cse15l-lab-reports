# Lab Report 4
In this lab report, I will reproduce the task from the competition on my own. 
For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like `<enter>` or `<tab>`, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands I ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

Key pressed: `<up> <up> <down> <down> <left> <right> <left> <right> <B> <A> <B> <A>`
